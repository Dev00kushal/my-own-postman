# System Design

## 1. Request Builder
   - **Description**: The core functionality of Postman revolves around constructing HTTP requests. Users should be able to create requests by specifying the method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), headers, URL parameters, and body.
   - **Importance**: Essential for interacting with APIs and testing endpoints effectively.

## 2. Response Viewer
   - **Description**: After sending a request, Postman should display the response to the user. This includes presenting the status code, headers, and body of the response in a user-friendly manner.
   - **Importance**: Allows users to easily interpret and analyze API responses.

## 3. History/Collection
   - **Description**: Postman should provide a mechanism for users to save requests for future use. This can be implemented as a history feature that remembers past requests or as a more advanced collection feature that enables users to organize requests into folders.
   - **Importance**: Facilitates reusability and organization of requests, enhancing productivity for users.

## 4. Authentication
   - **Description**: To support APIs that require authentication, Postman must offer a way for users to include authentication credentials with their requests. This could involve various authentication methods such as basic authentication, OAuth, API keys, etc.
   - **Importance**: Enables testing of secured APIs and ensures compatibility with various authentication mechanisms.

## 5. Environment Variables
   - **Description**: Postman allows users to define environment variables that can be utilized in requests. This advanced feature enables users to dynamically adjust request parameters based on different testing environments, improving flexibility and efficiency.
   - **Importance**: Facilitates testing of APIs in different environments without requiring manual adjustments for each request.
